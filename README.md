# async_server

Asynchronous programming on different languages

## Motivation

I needed to do a project with async programming for my lessons. I decided to do server, then thought to do that with different languages. So you can find solutions here:

- [NodeJS](https://github.com/mezgoodle/async_server/tree/master/nodejs)

- [Python](https://github.com/mezgoodle/async_server/tree/master/python)

- [Golang](https://github.com/mezgoodle/async_server/tree/master/golang)

## Conclusion

In my experience, I can say that the easiest way to make a server was on **JavaScript**, the hardest - **GoLang**. **Python** also is a powerfull(_as always_) tool for this task, but only with libraries.
